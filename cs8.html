    <p style="background-color: aliceblue; color: red;">The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for 
        subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter 
        because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats 
        Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers 
        for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an 
        honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the 
        assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually 
        becomes the town’s mayor.</p>
