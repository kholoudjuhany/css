                <div style="font-size: 14px;">The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and 
                    for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him 
                    shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne.
